## Project Description
SmartScootDB is a relational database system developed for managing an electric scooter network. It models users, rides, scooters, stations, and maintenance, using Oracle SQL and PL/SQL to automate operations and ensure data integrity.

## Objectives
Design a normalized relational schema for a scooter-sharing service
Implement business logic with PL/SQL (procedures, functions, triggers)
Track rentals, returns, scooter status, and user activity
Handle maintenance and usage history
Ensure robust exception handling and data validation

## Technologies Used
Oracle SQL – Schema definition, queries
PL/SQL – Procedures, functions, cursors, exception handling
SQL Developer – Interface for development and testing

## Database Entities
Users – Customer information
Scooters – Fleet details and availability
Stations – Locations for scooter pickup/drop-off
Rides – Rental records and durations
Maintenance – Logs for service history and repair actions

## Key Features
Add/update/delete users and scooters
Track active and past rentals
Manage maintenance scheduling
Trigger-based validations (e.g., prevent renting broken scooters)
